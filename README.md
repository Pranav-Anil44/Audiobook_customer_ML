Audiobook Customer Prediction

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether an audiobook customer will return and make a purchase within a given period. 
The dataset contains various user engagement metrics and purchase behavior data, which is used to train a machine learning model.

📊 Dataset

The dataset consists of the following features:
Book Length (mins) - Total length of the audiobook.
Book Length (mins) Average - Average book length.
Price - Price of the audiobook.
Price Average - Average price of audiobooks.
Review Provided (Binary) - Whether a review was provided (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
Review Rating (out of 10) - Rating given by the user.
Minutes Listened - Total minutes listened by the user.
Completion Percentage - Percentage of the audiobook completed.
Support Request Raised (Binary) - Whether the user raised a support request.
Last Visited - Purchased Date - Time difference between last visit and purchase.
The target variable is:
Customer Returned (Binary) - Whether the customer returned and made another purchase (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
